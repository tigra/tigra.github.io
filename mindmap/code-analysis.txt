  Let me analyze all layout code to identify assumptions, behaviors, and common principles across all layouts.

  1. Base Layout Class (`layout.js`)
  - Defines common functionality all layouts should implement
  - Provides utility methods for node sizing and position adjustment
  - Sets up the interface that all layouts must implement: `applyLayout`, `getParentConnectionPoint`, `getChildConnectionPoint`
  - Core assumption: layouts can be treated uniformly through this interface

  2. VerticalLayout (`vertical-layout.js`)
  - Places children vertically below or above the parent based on direction
  - Position children horizontally side by side
  - Uses direction ("up" or "down") to determine child positioning relative to parent
  - Calculates a bounding box based on all children's positions and sizes
  - Ensures parent is centered over children if children's total width exceeds parent's width
  - Assumptions:
    * Child nodes are arranged horizontally in a single row
    * Bounding box should contain all children and parent
    * Connection points change based on direction

  3. TapRootLayout (`taproot-layout.js`)
  - Balances child nodes into two columns (left and right) based on their heights
  - Sets child direction overrides to ensure consistent horizontal layout for children
  - Uses a gap between columns to separate left and right branches
  - Calculates bounding box to encompass both columns
  - Assumptions:
    * Children should be distributed between columns to balance heights
    * All children in left column should have "left" direction
    * All children in right column should have "right" direction
    * The bounding box needs to include all children in both columns

  4. HorizontalLayout (referenced but not analyzed in detail)
  - Places children horizontally to the left or right of parent
  - Uses direction ("left" or "right") for positioning
  - Similar assumptions as the vertical layout but in a horizontal orientation

  5. LayoutFactory
  - Creates appropriate layout instances based on type and parameters
  - Centralizes layout creation logic
  - Passes configuration parameters to layouts

  Common Principles:
  1. All layouts implement the same interface defined by the base Layout class
  2. Layouts are responsible for positioning parent and children
  3. Layouts calculate bounding boxes that encompass all content
  4. Layouts honor and set direction overrides
  5. Connection points depend on layout type and direction
  6. Each layout is self-contained and handles its own layout logic

  Issues observed:
  1. The primary issue seems to be with vertical-over-taproot configuration where VerticalLayout has children with TapRootLayout. The TapRootLayout's bounding boxes extend significantly left and right, which may
  cause overlaps when multiple TapRoot layouts are placed side by side by the VerticalLayout.

  2. The VerticalLayout doesn't account for the special characteristics of TapRootLayout children, particularly their wide horizontal extent. This leads to overlaps between adjacent TapRoot branches.

  3. Bounding box calculations may not always properly account for all of a child's actual space needs, especially for complex layouts like TapRoot.

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern
     - Layout algorithms (Vertical, Horizontal, TapRoot)
     - DOM manipulation for UI features
     - CSS flexbox layout
     - Draggable interface elements
     - Tabbed interface
     - SVG rendering for mindmaps
     - Bounding box calculations
     - Event handling for interactive elements
     - Style inheritance and override systems
     - Connection point calculations for mindmap branches

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `simple-mindmap-exporter.html`
        - The main HTML file that structures the UI
        - Modified to implement tab interface and draggable splitter
        - Added script imports for new functionality

     - `style.css`
        - Updated to support full-window layout with flexbox
        - Added styling for tabs, splitter, and responsive layout
        - Added classes to support dragging operations

     - `utils/splitter.js` (Created)
        - Implements draggable splitter functionality
        - Handles mouse and touch events for drag operations
        - Maintains minimum widths for panels

     - `utils/tab-manager.js` (Created)
        - Manages tab switching functionality
        - Provides clean interface for tab operations

     - `model/mindmap-model.js`
        - Modified to auto-collapse nodes of level 4 or higher
        - Improved Markdown parsing logic

     - `style/style-presets.js`
        - Updated color schemes for connection colors
        - Made connection indicators match connection colors but darker
        - Fixed overly light colors for better visibility

     - `renderer/mindmap-renderer.js`
        - Modified to use connection colors for indicators
        - Improved indicator styling and visibility

     - `layout/vertical-layout.js`
        - Contains vertical layout algorithm
        - Issue: Doesn't properly account for TapRoot children's full width

     - `layout/taproot-layout.js`
        - Distributes children into balanced left/right columns
        - Issue: Nodes from different TapRootLayouts can overlap when placed in vertical layout

     - `layout/layout.js`
        - Base class for all layouts
        - Defines the interface all layouts must implement
